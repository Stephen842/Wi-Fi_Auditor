__WiFi Security & Monitoring Auditor__

A Django-based toolkit for auditing WiFi security, tracking connected devices, and monitoring signal strength & speed. This project is designed for ethical use to help users improve their WiFi security and monitor network activity.

__Features__

*WiFi Security Auditor*

    1. Retrieve saved WiFi passwords (admin access required).

    2. Analyze password strength using a hash-based checker.

    3. Detect open (unsecured) WiFi networks.

*WiFi Connected Device Tracker*

    1. Scan and list all devices connected to a WiFi network.

    2. Detect unauthorized devices in real-time.

    3. Uses Scapy or ARP-scan for network discovery.

*WiFi Signal Strength & Speed Monitor*

    1. Display real-time WiFi signal strength.

    2. Run speed tests using speedtest CLI.

    3. Works with iwconfig (Linux) or netsh (Windows).

*Tech Stack*

    1. Backend: Django, Python

    2. Network Scanning: Scapy, ARP-scan

    3. Speed & Signal Monitoring: Speedtest CLI, iwconfig/netsh

    4. Frontend: HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Django Templates
